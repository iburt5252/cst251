  <p id="States">Here is a list of the States I've travled to the most.(No CA)</p>
  <p id="States">Louisiana <br>
  Outside of California the state I spend the most time in is Louisiana. This is because this is where my roots come from in my family.</p>
  <p id="States">Mississippi <br>
  The second state I spend the most time in outside of Califonia is Mississippi. My grandparents live in Mississippi so I go here all the time.</p>
  <p id="States">Texas <br>
  Another state I spend a good amount of time in is Texas. In Texas I have many uncles and aunts.<p>

  Lastly, I have been to Arizona a handful of times. My god parents live in Arizona. Also I played baseball for 14 years up until college. And I have played many national baseball tournaments as well as MLB scout tournaments.</p>
