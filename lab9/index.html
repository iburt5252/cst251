    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>For myself the only challenges I had were nothing. It was pretty easy syling my webpage just took a little
      <br>time from expirementing on what to include. Testing different color and styles took up most the time.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>As a stylish person myself haha, I had many didfferent ideas for the colors of my webpage design.
      <br>All my margins, borders, and padding was good. I just kept it simple, I wasnt really feeling
      <br>like going over the top.
      <br>Margins... <span id="bigword">Great!</span>
      <br>Borders... <span id="bigword">Great!</span>
      <br>Padding... <span id="bigword">Great!</span>
