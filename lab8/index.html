    <h1>Lab 8: CSS Selectors</h1>
    <p>The purpsoe of this lab was to experiment with CSS Selectors.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The only challenges I had with this lab was finishing it on time becasue I was out of town for the weekend. <br> <span> Thanks to my brother Jermey he helped me out with figuring out which images to add.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>After learning and experimenting with CSS Selectors, my page is finally done and certified. <div id="banger">'drippy'</div> <br>

    <p id="test">For this lab I ended up doing it super late because this past weekend I went to Oregon. My sister had a softball tournament and I got back home Sunday around like 2AM. <br> <span>
      My gangster Jermey held me down and stayed loyal to help me out becasue at the start I was a little confused. <br> The only reason I was confused was becasue I was exhusted and my brain was sleeping on me.
      At the end of the day we evntually did finish this lab.</p>
