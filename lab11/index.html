      <p id="ishsfacts">Who is Ish? I’m a Black African American male who lives in Elk Grove California. <br>
      Although I live in California majority of my family lives down South in Louisiana and Mississippi. <br>
      I have a few names I go like Ishmael(which is my real name), Ish, Ishy, IshyIsh, I.B., and <br>
      Burton(which is my last name). I am very religious and deeply appreciate everything God does. The meaning of <br>
      “Ishmael” is God hears. So, I know when I pray to him he always hears me. Another thing about myself is that <br>
      I love fashion. I enjoy buying new clothing pieces but the thing I stay on top of the most is Sneakers. I can confess <br>
      I am a Sneaker Head. I have about 50 some pairs of shoes but my favorite shoes are Air Jordan 1 High OGs.</p>
      <p id="ishsfacts">I hope you enjoyed these facts about IshyIsh.</p>

  <h1>Lab 11 Advanced Block-level Styling</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment with block level styling.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p> Some challenges I had in this lab was finishing the lab on time. My partner Jeremy <br>
  did a great job and finished his big I had him waiting because I had a 10 page paper to write <br>
  and I was up very late. I set my alarm to wake up pretty earlier but I slept through it. With the <br>
  styling I didn’t really have any issues but I did spend some time on the nav linking.
  <h2>Results</h2>
