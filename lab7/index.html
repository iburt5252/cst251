    <h1>Lab 7 Intro to CSS</h1>
    <p>The purpsoe of this lab is to make this lab 7 index, and style it using CSS.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>With this lab I did have some issues. The first thing was when linking the CSS. <br> 0riginally I believed that I finished, then I ran it locally and it didnt come up like i expected it to be. <br> So then I stared over and idi it again
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>As you can see I finished styling my page. The only thing I hope for is <br> its able to link properly unlike before.
