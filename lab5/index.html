<h1>Lab 5 More HTML</h1>
<p>The idea of this lab was to create a webpage with images and links to other pages. <br> We had the option to chose images and websites we like. This lab was fairly easy.

<h2>Chanllenges</h2>
<p>In this lab the only challege I had was differentiating between making a image file and the websites file.

	<p>Here are my images and links!</p>
