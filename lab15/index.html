  <h1>Lab 15 Fancy CSS</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment with the fancy CSS we learned in our lecture.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>In this lab the only challenges I had was figuring out how to do the layout for this page.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>In this the lab the results were fair. I tried some things that were pretty cool especially the blur affect. I liked that a lot.</p>
