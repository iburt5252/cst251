  <h1>Lab 15 Fancy CSS</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment with the fancy CSS we learned in our lecture.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>In this lab the only challenges I had was figuring out how to do the layout for this page.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>In this the lab the results were fair. I tried some things that were pretty cool especially the blur affect. I liked that a lot.</p>

  <h1 id="cartitle">The Best Thing That Happened This Week.</h1>
    <div id="forward">
    <p id="forewordtext">This past week my family and myself (Ish) purchased our tickets to travel this Thanksgiving. <br> We are traveling back south for the first time since the virus outbreak.</p>

    </div>
  <p id="cartexthead">My family and I are going to New Orleans and I cant be more excited. Personally, I had no time frame on when we would go back due to the virus. While my family are all excited we must be cautions.</p>
  <p id="cartext">Now, flying will be very crutial becasue we are going to see my grandparents and we dont want to bring anything to harm them. I feel it would be best my family and I change clothes before we get into our
  rental car and step foot into my grandparents house. It may be good to also change our shoes.</p>

  <p id="cartext">As you can see it looks very far from Sacramento (where I currently live) but the flight goes by fast its usually 3 hours and like 25 or 40 minutes. I feel like I am use to this flight due to the
  fact that I have been on this flight a numerous amount of times.
  <h2 id="carnext">Soon I will be in New Orleans, Louisiana and I will be informimg you about the "vacation".</h2>
