    <h1>Lab 10 styling Text Elements</h1>
    <p id="purpse">The purpsoe of this lab is to style the text elements within my webpage while
      <br>following CSS rules.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>For myself the only challenges I had were figuring out which text styles I wanted.<br></p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>As a stylish person myself haha, I had many didfferent ideas for the colors of my webpage design.
      <br>All my margins, borders, and padding was good. I just kept it simple, I wasnt really feeling
      <br>like going over the top. This lab wasnt hard at all becasuse the only changes were mainly just
      <br>the text styles of my web page.
      <br>Margins... <span id="bigword">Great!</span>
      <br>Borders... <span id="bigword">Great!</span>
      <br>Padding... <span id="bigword">Great!</span>
