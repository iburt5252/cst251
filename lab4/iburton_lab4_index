	<h1> Lab 4: File Transfer </h1>
		<p2> The idea of this lab was to be able to test files on my local system and tranfer the files to the server. <br> For this lab it was majority just reviewing what I have already done. I checked all the labs I've <br> already done. This lab was all about review.

		<h2> Chanllenges </h2>
		<p2> For this lab the main chanllenge was having to follow the instructions. <br> Using the knowledge from the last lab I feel like there was I few things I could do better. </p2>

		<h3> Results </h3>
		<p3> These are my screen shots </p3>
