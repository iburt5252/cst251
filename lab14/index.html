  <h1>Lab 14: Typography II</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this lab is to utilize block-level and typography css to recreate a more complicated webpage.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>There weren't any big challenges Ish or I faced, the last webpage we did was really good practice.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>I, Jeremy, believe we did a really good job at visually copying what the webpage looked like. Although functionally, it might not exactly work exaclty the same, I believe it still looks good enough at a glance!</p>
