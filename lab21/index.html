  <h1>Lab 21 2nd Draft Team Project Sketches</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this lab was to take each one of our ideas from the previous assignment, get feedback from our team, and further develop a few of these ideas.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p> In this lab the only challenges I had was figuring out how the arrangement of how my teams website will possibly look.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p> In this the lab the results were great. Overall I was happy about my sketches, including how my webpage came out for this lab. These skectches were more tidy
  and cleaned up compared tomy first ones.</p>
  <p> These are a few questions and answers I discused with my teamates. They gave me more feedback for making the sketches.</p>

  <p>Which sketches work and inspire the team?
    - The sketches that work and inspire my teammates are from my Subtopic Number 2.
    Which ones are moving in a direction that the team wants to go?
    - We are moving in a direction with a organized with flow from left to right possibly adding titles on the right.
    What could be improved? What could be further developed?
    - My teammates gave myself feedback and said I can add drop downs through the web pages.</p>
