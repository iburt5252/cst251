  <p id="text">The purpose of this lab was to experiment further with advanced block-level styling. Similar to the lab 15.</p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p id="text"> In this lab the only challenges I had was figuring out how to do the layout for this page.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p id="text"> In this the lab the results were fair. I just spent time playing around with styles.</p>

  <h1 id="cartitle">Yesterday in Sports</h1>
    <div id="forward">
    <p id="forewordtext">Yesterday was the last game of the 2020 World Series for Major League Baseball.</p>

    </div>
  <p id="cartexthead">The Los Angeles Dodgers played the Tampa Bay Rays. </p>
  <p id="cartext">This series was a best of 7 games, meaning you have to win four games against your opponent. It was a showdown or you can also say it was a nail bitter due to the fact that
  the Dodgers had to comb back and win after trailing majority of the game.</p>

  <p id="cartext">This game was in the Rays hands due to the fact they were winning and they had there best pitcher on the mound dealing the strikezone. The Rays pitcher was striking out
  the Dodgers best players like it was nothing but, the head coach of the Rays made a bold and mistake action of taking him out in the 6th inning. Taking him out just gave the Dodgers
  momentum becasue they were relieved that they did'nt have to face there best pitcher anymore. Now after taking out there ace the new pitcher came in and wasnt nearly as good as the ace.
  The Dodgers were able to put up 4 runs once the Rays best pitcher came out. And that was all they needed becasue the Rays didnt score the rest of the game. The first run came off a homerun
  by the Rays outfielder. That put them up 1-0 until the Dodgers were able to score 4 runs making it 1-4.</p>

  <h2 id="carnext">This victory gave the Dodgers a 4-2 series win and there first MLB World Series Championship since 1988.</h2>
